# WorkDay Scheduler
Description
This Work Day scheduler is used to schedule different appointments, tasks, assignments,  etc. The user is prompted to write the task in the textbox allocated time frame. The user has the option to save the text using the right side button. The text is then saved to local storage. Therefore when the user refreshes the page, the content in the workday scheduler is not lost. The scheduler is also displays the current date.

# Process for App Deployment
For Javascript quiz I used Javascript to make dynamic changes to the corresponding HTML document.

How does it work?
First the app is displayed in an HTML document that has the purpose of quizzing the user from a range of questions.
Once the user navigates to the gray text box in the body of the page, the user is prompted to write the task in the textbox allocated time frame. 
The user has the option to save the text using the right side button.
The text is then saved to local storage. Therefore when the user refreshes the page, the content in the workday scheduler is not lost. 
The workday scheduler can be found in Github pages, provided below is the link to the application:
